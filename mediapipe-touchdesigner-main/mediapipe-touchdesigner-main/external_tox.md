# Externalise tox
The MediaPipe tox is _**very large**_ (500MB+) and in order to keep your toe file saves fast and small, it is strongly suggested that you keep the MediaPipe tox external to the project, and link to it.

Once you drag the MediaPipe.tox file into your project, open the Parameters, then navigate to `Common` > and toggle `Enable External .tox`
